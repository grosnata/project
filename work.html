    </div>
        <div class="company text-block">
            <p>I worked at a technology startup, called Sensivo. Sensivo was created by Stefan (the CEO) and Aleks (the CTO). Their goal was to create a privary first toal for clinical researchers working with sensistive, personal data. In the European Union, there is the General Data Protection Regulation which states that processing personal data concerning health, genetics, or biometrics must be done in a way that safeguards the interests of the data subjects. Currently, researchers do not have an optimal software to effectively organize their data. This is wher Sensivo comes in. They are a a cloud-based, privacy first solution for clinical researchers. This allows researchers to store their data within a flexible, collaborative spreadsheet that was built from the ground up around GDPR.</p>

            <div class="FAQ text-block">
            <p>The first project I took on while at Sensivo was creating a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page for their website. The company wanted to be able to answer customers' questions in a simple, straighforward manner. Therefore, I started this project by searching for common questions customers had. I composed a list of questions that could be broken down into 4 main sections: General, How it Works, GDPR Compliance, and Privacy and Security. I answered these questions by using information from their website, information interviews with Stefan and Aleks, and by using company documentation. Then, once the content was created, I created the page using HTML and CSS. At this point, I didn't have any experience creating websites, so Aleks gave me the necessary code structure, so I could fill in what I was able to do. The page is now live on their website!</p>

      <div class="blogs text-block">
          <p>For this project, I was assigned the task of creating a few beginner blogs for Stefan's personal use. He did not give me any starting critera on what topics I should be writing about. Therefore, I researched other companies and what they wrote about when just starting off. I decided I was going to write about the backstory resulting in the creation of Sensivo. I interviewed Stefan and Aleks to get a better idea of their thoughts and experiences that got them to their current positions. Then, I composed a story beginning when they first met until they finally had created Sensivo. For the second and last blog, I decided to write about the books that helped Stefan in his entrepreneurial journey. He is a huge advocate of learning through reading, so I thought it would be a good blog topic that would allow readers to get to know more about him and his passions for entrepreneurship and learning. The blog consisted of the most impactful books he had read in the past year - beginning with a short summary and how the book enhanced his insights.  </p>

            <p>My third and final main project consisted of testing their software system. The system had not yet been made public as they were still in the developing stages. Therefore, they had to make sure it was functional and usable across many browsers and operating systems. Therefore, I took software and tested it in the two main operating systems (Macintosh and Windows) and on 5 main browsers. I then sent reports to the CTO so he could see what was working well and what could be improved before their first pilot test.</p>
